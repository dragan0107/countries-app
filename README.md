# **Countries app**

> ### In this project, I was provided with a design preview, and style details of the app and my task was to recreate the Front-end from scratch. Front-end communicates with the [REST Countries API v2.](https://restcountries.com/)

---

## Technologies used:

> ### Front-end is fully made in **_React_** and **_SASS_**, and no external packages were used apart from **_`axios`_** for data fetching.

## Functionalities:

- On initial run, it shows all countries.
- Countries can be filtered by continents.
- Countries can also be searched by their name.
- Implemented **_debouncing_** for the search input to optimize the app.
- By clicking on a country card, user is taken to the second page showing more details about the country itself, from which user can also return back to the home page.
- User can toggle between Dark / Light mode which persists on page reload.
